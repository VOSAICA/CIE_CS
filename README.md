# CIE Computer Science, including AS and AL

Though my codes are not good, at least I published it. I will keep on updating it as I am finishing my homework. You may copy my code as your homework for CIE Computer Science, but don't forget to give me a star. Appreciate.

If you don't know how to use git and don't want to learn it by yourself, then just quit CS.
